==========

Deploy git source code using fabric
--------------------
It works just like [Mina](https://github.com/mina-deploy/mina) but using [Fabric](https://github.com/fabric/fabric) and works with [Fabric-bolt](https://github.com/worthwhile/fabric-bolt) too.
* Offline hosts will be ignore and warn only instead of aborted
* Rollback failure feature is not completed yet
